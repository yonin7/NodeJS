//! Require:
// It is the builtin function and it is the easiest way to include modules that exist in separate files. The basic functionality of require is that it reads a JavaScript file, executes the file, and then proceeds to return the export object. It not only allows you to add built-in core Node modules but also community-based modules (node_modules), and local modules in the desired program. There are various inbuilt modules in a node like – HTTP module, URL module, query string module, path module and a lot more.

//! ES6 Import & Export:
// This statements are used to refer to an ES module. Other file types can’t be imported with these statements. They are permitted only in ES modules and the specifier of this statement can either be a URL-style relative path or a package name.Whereas Export statements allow the user to export his created objects and methods to other programs. For instance, if you assign a string literal then it will expose that string literal as a module.
